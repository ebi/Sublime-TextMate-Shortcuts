The goal of Sublime-TextMate-Shortcuts is to get the shortcuts as close as possible to TextMate. Since I mainly work on OSX I want to have a similar editor on Windows.

For me personally I remapped the following keys:
Left Alt to Left Control
Left Windows to Left Alt
CapsLock to Left Control

If you wan't to have the same execute Keymap.reg

Shortcuts that are changed:

Command-E: Alt-E
Command-Shift-E: Alt-E
